Capstone project ideas: 

National weather service free api public data, show weather forecast, radar, satellite, forecast discussion. 
I would add my own insights and forecasts as well. Graphics would be used along with scientific explanations on page.

National Hurricane Center free api public information, to show graphics and information about any developing tropical cyclones. 
I will add explanations for each possible area of tropical cyclone development. 
Navigation bar will help organize information and allow users to key in on specific cyclones or weather forecasts. 

Public api databases of past hurricanes and tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean using free api resources to pull 
information on historical cyclones to my website. A navigation bar will allow a user to narrow their exploration based 
on year or hurricane location. Graphics will contain information about hurricanes and be captioned with detailed meteorological 
and atmospheric physics concepts influencing the life cycle of certain hurricanes.

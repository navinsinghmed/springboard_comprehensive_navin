This page contains Tampa Bay Storm Chaser Information with link to my youtube Channel with
over a thousand weather videos from storms and hurricanes in Tampa Bay, Florida since 2012.

This app allows you to enter a city and obtain weather data for that city including temperature,
feels like temperature, humidity, and windspeed.

The user simply enters a city and will see all the above features. The features include temperature, feels like temperature, humidity, windspeed, and a graphic of sky conditions. Temperature is included to provide the user with how it feels to be at that city. 

Humidity demonstrates how muggy or humid it feels. The feels like temperature takes into account humidity and expresses what it feels like to the human skin in terms of temperature, which is usually hotter than the air temperature. 

The windspeed illustrates how windy it is in a city. These feautures reveal what it feels like and looks like in terms of weather conditions at a given city that the user types in.
